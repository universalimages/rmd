      This document describes a standard for storing metadata related to
      art direction in responsive images. It is based on the [[!XMP]] standard which
      is supported by most image formats and programming languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author of an image can embed the rules for art direction directly into the image file. A web server that processes the image can then crop it
      according to those rules. The [[html-picture-element]] can be used to request the matching version of the image from the server.
    </p>

    <p>As a First Public Working Draft, this document is incomplete. The editors seek to illustrate the full scope of the best practices- albeit with the details missing at this stage. In particular, the examples for each best practice are largely incomplete. The editors intend to compile a much richer set of examples in the period leading up to publication of the next Working Draft. Feedback is requested on the scope of this document and the best practices herein. The editors are particularly keen for reviewers to cite examples that may be used to further illustrate these best practices.</p>
    <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="informative">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Art direction in the context of universal images means cropping and re-framing an image in one or two dimensions depending on the context it is in.
    </p>
    <p>Art directed responsive images start with the photographer. The current situation is that the person who uploads an image to a web server usually  makes the decision how an image is cropped.
    Apart from the technical challenges there are also legal ones. In general, copyright prohibits altering a work of art in any way, even cropping it. (The interpretation of this differs between countries).
    However, most image agencies allow cropping an image in their license agreements. Nevertheless, this is a factor that has to be taken into consideration when a server is supposed to automatically crop an image.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this standard is to give authors and copyright holders a possibility to define the responsive behavior of their images. For web developers and content editors it would simplify things when dealing with responsive issues. Images would always be framed correctly on every device and screen size.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="informative">
    <h1>Audience</h1>
    <p>The audience is professionals in the web publishing environment. The most important groups are described below.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Image authors (aka photographers)</h2>
      <p>The photographers as the authors of an image are the only persons that can decide how and if their image can be altered. This standard allows them to define the rules for the responsive behavior of their images themselves.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Online editors</h2>
      <p>They are the ones who publish images together with their editorial content. Up until now they specified a focus point within the image themselves, if the content management system allowed it.<br/>
      With images that have responsive information embedded, this will not be necessary anymore.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Web developers</h2>
      <p>When using stock images for responsive designs, developers have to make
        sure that when re-sizing the browser window, important areas of the image are not cut off.<br>
        With universal images the web framework takes care of correctly cropping the images.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h1>Definition</h1>
    <section>
    <h2>Namespace</h2>
      <p>The namespace for this standard is <code>http://universalimages.github.io/rmd/1.0/</code>. <br/>
      The version is part of the URL. While the standard is still in the first draft phase, a version below 1.0 SHOULD be used. The prototype implementations are currently using version 0.1.
      </p>
      <p>The XML namespace prefix is <strong>rmd</strong></p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Units</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Pixel (px)</dt>
        <dd>A single pixel of an image file.</dd>
        <dt>Display-independent pixel (dp), aka CSS Pixel</dt>
        <dd>This pixel is defined by a viewing angle and is independent of the physical medium. It is defined in section 4.3.2 of [[!CSS2]]. It is around 12.8' or "the visual angle of one pixel on a device with a pixel density of 96dpi and a distance from the reader of an arm's length".
        </dd>

      <p>Absolute values are set in display-independent CSS pixels as defined in section 4.3.2 of [[!CSS2]]. In the following document the unit <dfn>dp</dfn> is used.</p>
      <p>The only exception to the above is for the image dimensions, where the actual
        pixel values are used. This is marked with the unit <dfn>px</dfn>.
      <p>Relative values are between 0 and 1</p>
      <p>
        The point (0, 0) is the top left point relative to the <strong>upright</strong> image. (After Exif rotation has been applied.)

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        The default behavior for cropping MUST follow these rules:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the container element is larger or equal to the CropArea (or the width of the image), then the image MUST NOT be cropped.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the container element is smaller or equal to the MaxWidth value of the SafeArea, then the image MUST be cropped to the safe area only. This rule also applies if the calculated height is smaller than the height of the SafeArea.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the SafeArea is not defined, then only one axis MAY be cropped (past the crop defined by the CropArea).
          </li>
          <li>
            If the container size is in between the two, then the behavior depends on the Interpolation field. If it is set to linear and the MaxWidth is set on the SafeArea tag, then the target width MUST be in between the SafeArea and the CropArea. If the Interpolation is set to step, then the closest matching recommended crop MUST be chosen. If it is not defined, then step SHOULD be assumed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        All values have to be normalized to dp for the calculations.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        The recommended way to process the image is described in the
        <a href="#activity-diagram">activity diagram</a> which is referenced in the appendix.

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>The following is a collection of use cases where art direction is used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Small devices</strong>: Smartphones, especially when held in portrait mode, simply cannot show an image the size the photographer has envisioned it. Sometimes details cannot be recognized in a small image due to their size. To keep up with &nbsp;editorial integrity, one has to find a balance between zooming in to show what is going on and&nbsp;the overall image composition.</li>
        <li><strong>Different layouts</strong>: Websites could use the same image in different places. For each layout the image would be displayed in the size and aspect ratio required&nbsp;by the layout.</li>
        <li><strong>Fluid images</strong>: Websites often use a fluid grid where the column with is relative to the browser width. If images have a fixed height and a dynamic width then parts of the image can get cropped in the browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptive images</strong>: Images can be displayed full screen on mobile devices no matter if the user is holding the device in portrait or landscape mode.</li>
